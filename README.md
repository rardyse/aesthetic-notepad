# aesthetic-notepad

/!\ IN CONSTRUCTION /!\

## quick presentation :

this project was created because i just needed a **simple BUT STILL cute space** to write down my thoughts, ideas, goals and tasks. the default one is also very boring so I just decided to go for it and create my own little app.
whether it’s jotting down a to-do list, keeping some quick notes in class, writing a random midnight thought to not forget the next day, or reviewing all your saved notes : this little notepad is here to support your brain (well kindaaaaa)


## features :

- **simple note-writing section**  
  just a sweet lil area where you can write freely (ideas, class notes, ...)

- **to-do section with checkboxes**  
  make tasks, tick them off, feel accomplished (your tasks are saved automatically between sessions!)

- **organized note list viewer**  
  check out all your past notes in one place


## technologies used :

- `tkinter` – for the user interface  
- `json` – to save and load your notes and to-do lists locally  
- `os` – for handling file paths and local storage  
- `customtkinter` – (optional) to keep the UI soft and modern  
- `datetime` – (optional) to timestamp your notes


## inspiration :
- i saw some Pinterest samples and thought it could be nice to do the same cute thing but "technologically" from scratch


### of course you are absolutely free to re-use it and re-style it as you need and wish :)


with huge pleasure,
